I'm a graduate student of [WHU](https://en.whu.edu.cn/). This blog site is used to archive some notes about learning programming.

My blog is generated by **Not Pure Poole**, which is a simple, beautiful, and powerful Jekyll theme for blogs. It is built on [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) and [Pure](https://purecss.io/).

For more information about Not Pure Poole, please browse the [README](https://github.com/vszhub/not-pure-poole) file.
